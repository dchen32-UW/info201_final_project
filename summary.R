# Summary:


# Take Away One:

# Through out this assignment we learned how the eath has changed over the past
# few years. This change is in temperatures, water levels, and more. We used 
# different graphs to show how the climate has changed in different ways.


# Take Away Two:

# One of our graph talks about natural disasters. It shows how the amount of 
# natural disasters have spiked over the years. What is cool about our graph
# is you an choose the year or type of natural disater so you can focus on
# certain ones or certain years. This is important to seeing the difference
# between years between natural disaters.


# Take Away Three:

# The last graph shows the change in temperature. What is cool about this is we
# added colors to it to show the difference in different countries and 
# years. This helps the viewer look more into it and better understand how
# the temperature has changed throughout the years.
# what is cool is you can pick a specific country and look at that one
# individually. Some countries have data farther back so it is interesting
# to go to different years and still see the changes throughout the years.
# Most data comes within the last 100 years so it is all fairly recent.
