    One major difference between the clustering shown above, and the clustering in the previous section is the size of the clusters. While the previous section essentially had a north cluster and south cluster of countries, this clustering seems to be <span class = 'hint'>better distributed</span> and has <span class = 'hint'>more equally sized</span> clusters. To get an idea of each cluster's location and representative countries we plot these groups onto a world map below.
