    As seen above, there appears to be some geographical significance in the clustering for the right most cluster, which appears to be exclusively from the "Europe & Central Asia" mega region. However, the other clusters appear to be less defined by a single mega region and are more <span class = 'hist'>heterogeneous in which mega regions they come from</span>. Therefore, to identify the location of these different groups, we again us <span class = 'package'>hclust</span> to identify clusters via <span class = 'package'>h = 0.5</span> and identify the clustering below.
