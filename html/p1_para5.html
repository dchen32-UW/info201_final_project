      As seen above, these two large groups have high geographical significance.
      <span class = 'hint'>Group 1 lies strictly above the equator</span>,
      and
      <span class = 'hint'>Group 2 lies strictly below it</span>.
      Thinking about the measurments taken, we can identify that we are seeing the correlations between countries on a
      <span class = 'hint'>monthly basis</span>
      and as such the
      <span class = 'point'>two main groups are a result of seasonal changes</span>.
      All of the countries in Group 1 move together across seasons, yet Group 2, because they lie on the opposite side of the earth will be moving through the opposite seasons. This explains the
      <span class = 'hint'>strong, negative correlation</span>
      between the two groups, and
      <span class = 'hint'>strong, positive correlation</span>
      within them. As these seasonal changes are overwhelmingly strong, any more minute changes are smothered, and we cannot draw insights that might point to overall temperature change. While we could average the years together, thereby eliminating the seasonal effect we would be losing valuable monthly information. As such we explore another option below that would help us maintain this monthly level information but also examine correlations between countries.
