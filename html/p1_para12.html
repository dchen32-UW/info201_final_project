    As seen above, the clear seperation of "Europe & Central Asia" in the EMD correlation matrix comes from it's uniquely high latitude magnitude. The mesh of the "Latin America & Carribbean", "East Asia & Pacific", and "Sub-Saharan Africa" regions come from their similar latitude which results in a smaller change in mean temperature and thus similar densities. More similar densities cause their countries to be grouped closer together as they will have a smaller EMD metric. Thus we can explain the distribution of the mega regions on the EMD matrix using their corresponding latitudes.

    Through a careful examination of the correlations between countries via all recorded temperature measurments <span class = 'hint'>we revealed the strength and overwhelming nature of seasonal effects</span>, and showed how this could not be used to identify countries changing in temperature together. To combat this we utilized EMD, a metric to compare similar densities, and computed changes in temperatures to make monthly temperatures comparable across all countries. This resulted in a <span class = 'point'>novel distribution of countries on a world map that was tightly linked to latitude</span>. This led us to explore the relationship between latitude and change in mean land temperature and revealed a <span class = 'point'>strong positive correlation between the magnitude of latitude and the rate of temperature increase across countries</span>. To dig deeper and reveal the reasons why this is occurring, further data gathering and testing would need to be done. However, we do believe this data reveals an increased vulnerability of countries with a high latitude magnitude to rapid increase in mean land temperature, and thus these countries in particular should allocate more resources to combat the dangerously quick climate change we face today.
