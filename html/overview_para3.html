  This project will focus on the impacts of <span class = 'point'>global climate change</span> by considering <span class = 'hint'>temperature changes</span> and changes in <span class = 'hint'>natural disaster events</span>. We aim to visualize trends in global disasters and temperature data to reveal potential solutions to mitigate and reverse its impacts. Furthermore, our analyses will help <span class = 'hint'>illuminate areas that have been differentially impacted by climate change</span>. This will allow us to allocate resources accordingly to areas that are likely to suffer greater climate disruption and disasters. We hope that this project will lead to greater awareness of the extent of climate change impacts as well as an understanding of which areas need the most attention and resources for combating the effects of climate change. Moreover, we hope that it will demonstrate the <span class = 'point'>need for urgent reductions in carbon emissions</span> in industrialized nations, worldwide cooperation, and assistance for those suffering the most from climate change.
