      Our last page <span class = 'hint'>Change in Temperature Between Years</span> examines how temperatures have changed across different countries over time. We found that temperatures have been steadily rising across all countries with a differentially high rate of temperature increase in more Northern countries, these are also the furthest from the equator (greatest absolute latitude) which agrees with our initial takeaway. We can confirm this point by looking at the countries with the largest and smallest changes in temperature from 1912 and 2012, an arbitary range of 100 years.
