    For our dataset 1, average land temperatures per country, we are interested in exploring the true impacts of climate change. Particularly we would like to determine how
    <span class = 'hint'>
      different countries
    </span>
    <span class = 'point'>
      correlate
    </span>
    with each other. We first take a look at some innate relationship between countries by examining all of the monthly mean land temperature measurments from 1743 to 2013 across all countries. We utilize the
    <span class = 'package'>
      countrycode
    </span>
    package to link countries to
    <span class = 'hint'>
      mega regions
    </span>
    , which are large conglomerations of countries that are geographically similar. They are not neccessarily continent based, as mega regions can spread across continents and not encompass an entire continent. Furthermore, as our dataset does not necessarily contain data for every single country we include a coloring called
    <span class = 'hint'>
      Not Considered
    </span>
    that indicates the country was not considered when calculating the heatmap and world map, and as such does not have a value or a grouping. Below, we plot the different mega regions on a world map to show where each mega region resides.
