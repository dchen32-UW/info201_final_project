    While the arrangement of these groups may seem meaningless upon first glance, identification of the equator and each group's relative position from such reveals a clear cut pattern. The groups are arranged such that they <span class = 'point'>represent different distances from the equator</span>. Group 3 lies upon the equator, group 4 is one step further, then group 2 and group 5 are the next step away, with group 1 being the furthest from the equator. As such, we reveal that <span class = 'hint'>latitude is a major player in the rate at which countries are increasing in their mean land temperature</span>. While this provides us with a more qualitative perspective on the impact of latitude on rate of average land temperature increase across time, we utilize a scatterplot, shown below, to provide a quantitative examination of change in temperature by latitude.
