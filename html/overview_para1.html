      Since the Industrial Revolution, fossil fuel sources have been the primary source of energy for the world. However, when these fossil fuels are burned, they emit greenhouse gases. According to <a href = "https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">NASA</a>, increases in greenhouse gases raise global temperatures and contribute to various issues such as ocean acidification and extreme weather events, such as natural disasters. These issues present a problem that may only become worse in coming years unless we eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels.

      One type of extreme weather event that has been increasingly featured in the news is hurricanes. Warmer ocean temperatures <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/20/are-hurricanes-getting-stronger-and-is-the-climate-crisis-to-blame">lead to more hurricanes</a> due to moist air from the ocean's surface condensing in the atmosphere. These hurricanes regularly ravage the Caribbean and the East Coast of the US, and similarly, cyclones devastate the South Pacific and countries like Bangladesh. While news stories provide an inaccurate understanding of the state of climate change and natural disasters, we aim to use a data driven approach to get a closer look at these issues.
