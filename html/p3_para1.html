      We initially set the years to be 1912 and 2012 to show a recent 100 year change that encompasses the majority of the countries. As you use years further and further in the past, the information becomes more sparse and data tends to selectively come from European countries. Interestingly, this graph shows a preferential increase in temperature in more Northern countries. This observation is in concurrence with our discovery, found in <span class = 'hint'>Correlation in Temperature Changes</span>, that absolute latitude is strongly, positively correlated with rate of temperature increase.
