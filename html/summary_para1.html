      Through out this project we identified a multitude of ways Earth's climate has been changing in the recent years. In our first analysis, we examined the mean land temperature changes across countries and identified countries that were changing in temperature together by looking at their average 70 year change from the months of 1912-1942 to the months of 1982-2012. Utilizing Wasserstein's distance metric and <span class = 'package'>hclust</span> to cluster countries together, we discovered a <span class = 'point'>strong, positive correlation between latitutde and the amount of temperature increase</span> in their average 70 year temperature change. Just as a brief reminder, we display the distributions of the different groups, determined in <span class = 'hint'>Correlation in Temperature Changes</span>, on a world map below.
