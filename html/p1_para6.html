      Understanding the correlations between countries and their change in mean land temperature is <span class = 'hint'>crucial</span> to support the proper allocation of climate change prevention resources. As shown in the previous section, while monthly information is valuable, the seasonal effect is so overwhelming that we end up only seeing seasonal effects. As such, we need a way to identify countries that have similar changes in mean land temperature without being affected by seasonal changes in temperature. To do such, we implement a distance metric called <span class = 'point'>Wasserstein's distance metric</span>, also called <span class = 'hint'>Earth Mover's Distance or EMD</span>. Generally it can be thought of the energy need to transform one pile of earth, such as the one on the lower left, to another pile of earth, such as the one on the lower right.
