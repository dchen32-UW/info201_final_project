    It is important to look at the <span class = 'hint'>trends of temperature change and natural disasters</span>. These trends highlight whether temperatures and natural disasters have been increasing or not, and it is necessary to provide this information to the public and to lawmakers. While it is widely accepted that humans play a dominant role in driving carbon emissions, there is little discussion about how temperatures and certain disaster events have been dramatically increasing along with carbon emissions.
