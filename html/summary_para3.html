      In our <span class = 'hint'>Disaster Count Per Year</span> page, we show how natural disasters have spiked over the years. While, certain natural disasters have had a greater total increase in count per year, all natural disasters, when examined individually, have had an increase in their count across time. We utilize a summary table below and sort it by time to show how natural disasters have increased both in count and amount of damage across time. Below we show count of natural disasters.
