      As seen above, there is a clear trend between latitude, in terms of it's magnitude (i.e. distance from the equator), and the change in mean land temperature of a country. This reveals the key insight that <span class = 'point'>countries further away from the equator have differentially higher rates of temperature increase</span>. While this data does not reveal the cause of such a phenomenon, it does demonstrate that it is occurring and, as such, requests further research to be done to identify the reasons behind its existence. Furthermore, we can examine the vague mega region correlations with the <span class = 'package'>hclust</span> determined clusters seen in the above heatmaps by also plotting mega regions onto the same temperature change by absolute latitude plot. Again, we provide sliders to allow for the manipulation of the axe so custom filtering can take place.
