      Interestingly, while the country with the greatest change is indeed one with an extremely large latitude magnitude, the country with the smallest change is one that is not extremely close to the equator. Perhaps there was a yearly fluke in temperature and we needed to consider more data, but this does show that more Northern countries have greater increases in mean land temperature over time.
