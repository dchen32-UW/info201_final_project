    As shown above, EMD represents the <span class = 'hint'>work or energy needed to complete a transformation between densities</span>, which can be represented as different piles of earth. Thus, for our dataset we take every month between 1982-2012 and compute the 70 year change in temperature. An example calculation would be January of 2012 - January of 1942. With 12 months x 31 years = 372 measurments per country we have sufficient datapoints to create a reasonably detailed histogram, using <span class = 'package'>hist</span> and each countries' change in temperature from the early 1900s to the early 2000s. While we could have just used the 12 months from one year in the past and one year in the present, we don't believe that is accurate because a single monthly fluke or an entire yearly fluke in temperature could cause the data to vary wildly. Using a range of 30 years allows us to account for potential flukes in temperature measurments, providing us with a more accurate story of how mean land temperatures have changed from the past to the present. We standarize these histograms by using the same binwidth, number of bins, and min and max on the x-axis. These histograms can be used as densities by accessing the <span class = 'package'>hist$density</span> value, we then pass these into a custom function that computes the distance matrix via the Wasserstein distance function, specifically <span class = 'package'>wasserstein1d</span> from the <span class = 'package'>transport</span> package. We then use a heatmap similar to the one in the previous section to plot a "correlation matrix", essentially just a distance matrix, of the EMD between different countries. In this case, we are interested to see if the previous geographical significance in the country clustering is still present post seasonal effect elimination by coloring on the mega regions defined in the previous section.
