    In order to more quantitatively show the geographical significance in the clustering results of monthly mean land temperature measurments, we utilize the
    <span class = 'package'>hclust</span>
    package to group and classify clusters via a cutoff of
    <span class = 'hint'>h = 0.5</span>.
    While we could have used
    <span class = 'hint'>k = # of clusters</span>,
    we wanted to use
    <span class = 'hint'>h</span>,
    as it provides a more empirical cutoff by cutting a line at a certain height, in this case 0.5, on the dendrogram (the clustering tree) instead of relying on a more artifical number of clusters. Since we use this same cutoff on heatmaps based on other data, their individual clusterings become comparable and we can examine how their differing dendrograms, at the same degree of correlation, cluster differently. Below we show the same correlation matrix as above except with the grouping, determined via the previously described cutoff, colored on as a column annotation, similarly to how we previously showed the distribution of mega regions.
